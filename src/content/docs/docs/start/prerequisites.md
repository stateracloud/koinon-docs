Koinon installs with one Helm chart. The chart does not install its prerequisites. The install
checks for them first (the preflight, see below) and fails with a clear message when one is missing.

The versions below are the ones the preflight (`internal/preflight`) and the end-to-end test use. The script
[`test/e2e/kind/up.sh`](https://github.com/stateracloud/koinon/blob/main/test/e2e/kind/up.sh)
installs all of them on a kind cluster. A check in CI keeps this page and that script in step.

| Prerequisite | Version | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kubernetes | 1.30 or newer; tested on 1.37 | Everything. The chart requires 1.30 (`kubeVersion`), where ValidatingAdmissionPolicy v1 is GA. The end-to-end test runs `kindest/node:v1.37.0`. |
| Agent Sandbox | v1.0.10 | The sandbox objects. The preflight needs a controller image tagged `v1.0.x`. |
| OpenShell gateway | 0.1.7 | Creating and running sandboxes. |
| A sandbox RuntimeClass | `kata`, or `runc` on kind | Isolation. The default is `kata` (ADR 0045). |
| CloudNativePG | 1.30.1 | The database, when `postgres.mode` is `cnpg` (the default). |
| Postgres | 18 or newer | The database, when `postgres.mode` is `external`. |
| A NetworkPolicy engine | kube-network-policies v1.1.2 on kind | Koinon's NetworkPolicies. |
| Helm | 4.3.1 | `helm install`. |

You also need `kubectl`, `jq` and a GitHub account that can create a GitHub App.

## Kubernetes and a NetworkPolicy engine

Use a cluster at version 1.30 or newer that enforces NetworkPolicy. The chart refuses to install on an older one (`kubeVersion` in `Chart.yaml`), because the admission policy needs ValidatingAdmissionPolicy v1. Koinon is tested on 1.37, so prefer that version when you can. The preflight warns, and does
not fail, when it cannot show enforcement. The chart uses standard NetworkPolicy only. It needs no
CNI-specific feature.

On a laptop, use kind v0.33.0. Its default node image is `kindest/node:v1.37.0`. kind's own network
plugin does not enforce NetworkPolicy, so install kube-network-policies:

```sh
kind create cluster --name koinon --image kindest/node:v1.37.0@sha256:a1ed56cfb0e7b93589bdf97c8cd566405a265939e3620fc4f5de89adff580ae5
curl -fsSL -o knp.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-network-policies/v1.1.2/install.yaml
echo "a8345bd40f74e812c7f2e13c40a841d4d6c7b1fc22e245750116072807a0f4ba  knp.yaml" | shasum -a 256 -c -
kubectl apply -f knp.yaml
```

## CloudNativePG

Skip this if you use `postgres.mode: external`.

```sh
curl -fsSL -o cnpg.yaml https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/releases/download/v1.30.1/cnpg-1.30.1.yaml
echo "37237f145d8138256ea25ae830f87759255665ff08f8d552fdd8224a5ec032fb  cnpg.yaml" | shasum -a 256 -c -
kubectl apply --server-side -f cnpg.yaml
kubectl -n cnpg-system rollout status deploy/cnpg-controller-manager --timeout=180s
```

The end-to-end test also pins the operator image to digest
`sha256:923c267ec29636db3bee20f993d0ec4973fa22998e1adad37da79e4d32b5bc07`. The chart pins its
Postgres image (18.6) by digest in `values.yaml`.

With an external Postgres, create one libpq URI per role in a Secret and name it in
`postgres.external.secretName`. The roles are `migrate`, `api`, `reconciler` and `agentd`. The
migrate role owns the schema. The other roles need only DML, except that the `api` login role must
also be a member of a `koinon_install_audit_writer` group role, which is the only role that may write
the install audit chain (ADR 0100). An administrator creates it once, before the first migration (the
migrate role usually has no `CREATEROLE`; without the role the migrate Job fails before it migrates
anything). `koinon-api` checks its own membership when it starts: when it is missing it logs the
`GRANT` to run for the login it connects as, and serves anyway:

```sql
CREATE ROLE koinon_install_audit_writer NOLOGIN;
GRANT koinon_install_audit_writer TO <api login role>;
```

If the migrate role is not the one that owns the tables, or the role `koinon_app` does not exist, also
run this after the first migration, so that the reconciler and agentd can read the install audit
chain and not write it:

```sql
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON install_audit_events, install_audit_chain_head, install_audit_anchor_heads FROM <reconciler login role>, <agentd login role>;
GRANT SELECT ON install_audit_events, install_audit_chain_head, install_audit_anchor_heads TO <reconciler login role>, <agentd login role>;
```

Give `api`, `reconciler` and `agentd` separate logins: if they share one, the reconciler can write
the install audit chain too and the separation the chain relies on is gone. See "The install audit
chain" in the [Secret keys](/docs/operate/secret-keys/) page.

If you set `api.durable.enabled` (the DBOS runtime for schedules and durable timers), the migration
Job also creates a `dbos` schema, so the migrate role needs `CREATE` on the database. The other
roles need `USAGE` on that schema, `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` on its tables and `USAGE,
SELECT` on its sequences. The Job grants these to a role named `koinon_app` when one exists; with
external roles, grant them yourself after the first migration. Without `api.durable.enabled` the
Job does not touch the `dbos` schema and needs no database-level privilege.

## Agent Sandbox

```sh
curl -fsSL -o agent-sandbox.yaml https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/releases/download/v1.0.10/sandbox-with-extensions.yaml
echo "7cc1eca2fb45844b0ec0c35fc975340dc01af2994301ffa8bf05db1ad1e397ee  agent-sandbox.yaml" | shasum -a 256 -c -
kubectl apply --server-side -f agent-sandbox.yaml
kubectl -n agent-sandbox-system rollout status deploy/agent-sandbox-controller --timeout=180s
```

## RuntimeClass

Koinon runs sandboxes under the RuntimeClass named in `openshell.runtimeClassName`. The default is
`kata`. Kata puts each sandbox in its own small VM. Use it anywhere you can. Install it the way your
distribution documents (on Talos, the `kata-containers` extension).

OpenShell only attaches RuntimeClasses that carry the label `openshell.ai/sandbox-attachable`. Label
yours if it does not have it.

kind has no VM runtime. For a throwaway cluster, use `runc` and say so in your values (the
[quickstart](/docs/start/quickstart/) shows how):

```sh
kubectl apply -f - <<'YAML'
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: runc
  labels:
    openshell.ai/sandbox-attachable: "true"
handler: runc
YAML
```

`runc` shares the node's kernel with the sandbox. Do not use it for real work.

## OpenShell gateway

Install the OpenShell chart, pinned by version and digest. The values file is the one the
end-to-end test uses,
[`test/e2e/kind/openshell-values.yaml`](https://github.com/stateracloud/koinon/blob/main/test/e2e/kind/openshell-values.yaml).
Set `server.defaultRuntimeClassName` in it to your RuntimeClass.

```sh
helm upgrade --install openshell \
  "oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/helm-chart@sha256:3e5998c749390a6be3a4f553e52e488b6f692e19be7b8bf681a26285d1e18901" \
  --version 0.1.7 --namespace openshell --create-namespace \
  -f openshell-values.yaml --wait --timeout 5m
```

The chart generates a client certificate Secret, `openshell-client-tls`, in the `openshell`
namespace. The [quickstart](/docs/start/quickstart/) copies it into Koinon's namespace.

OpenShell 0.1.7 pulls its supervisor image from `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/supervisor:0.1.7`. Koinon's
admission policy allows exactly that image. If you pull it through a mirror, set the OpenShell chart's
`global.image.registry` to the mirror followed by `/nvidia` (its image paths are `openshell/...`, and its
default is `ghcr.io/nvidia`) and Koinon's `global.imageRegistry` or `global.registryMirrors` to
the same place, and the two agree; otherwise list your reference in `sandboxPolicy.supervisorImages`.
The policy also lets a supervisor pod carry only the gateway's own ServiceAccount token, with a lifetime of
at most `sandboxPolicy.supervisorTokenMaxSeconds` (default 3600, OpenShell's default). If you set
`OPENSHELL_K8S_SA_TOKEN_TTL_SECS` on the gateway above 3600, raise `sandboxPolicy.supervisorTokenMaxSeconds`
to match, or no sandbox can start.
For a private registry, set `server.sandboxImagePullSecrets` on the OpenShell release. See
[Private registries and mirrors](/docs/operate/private-registries/).

Koinon needs OpenShell's `gatewayId` (its chart default is `openshell`) as `openshell.gatewayId`: workspace
namespaces are named `openshell-<gatewayId>-<workspace>`, and the sandbox observer reads sandbox pods there.
The sandbox admission policies are keyed on it too: they bind only to namespaces labelled
`openshell.ai/gateway-id=<openshell.gatewayId>` (`sandboxPolicy.scopeToGateway`, default true). If the value differs
from the gateway's real `gateway_id`, the policies would match no sandbox namespace, so the preflight fails.
The observer is a small cluster-scoped grant, on by default: the reconciler may create one RoleBinding per
workspace namespace and bind one ClusterRole (`get` on pods and Sandboxes), fenced by a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.
Platform teams that refuse it set `sandboxObserver.enabled: false`; see
[Agent health](/docs/operate/agent-health/#how-koinon-finds-the-cause).

## The preflight

`helm install` runs a pre-install Job, `koinon-api preflight`. It fails the release when it finds
any of these:

- Agent Sandbox is missing, or its controller image is not `v1.0.x`.
- The OpenShell gateway is not reachable at `openshell.address`, or its version is not 0.1.7.
- The RuntimeClass in `openshell.runtimeClassName` does not exist.
- OpenShell's gateway ConfigMap (`preflight.openshell.namespace` and `.configMap`, default `openshell/openshell-config`) cannot be read or has no `gateway.toml` while a supervisor image is configured, which the chart always does.
- `openshell.gatewayId` differs from the gateway's `gateway_id` while `sandboxPolicy.enabled` and `sandboxPolicy.scopeToGateway` are true: the admission policies would apply to no sandbox.
- The CloudNativePG operator is missing (when `postgres.mode` is `cnpg`).
- The agentgateway `GatewayClass`, its `agentgateway.dev` CRDs or a v1.7.x controller are missing (when `gateway.mode` is `kubernetes`; see [Gateway modes](/docs/operate/gateway-modes/)).

It warns, and does not fail, when Kata guest seccomp is off (ADR 0048), when your cluster does
not enforce NetworkPolicy, or when
`sandboxObserver.enabled` is false. (A `gatewayId` mismatch only warns when `sandboxPolicy.scopeToGateway` is false.) Turn the seccomp probe off with `preflight.seccompProbe.enabled: false`
on `runc`, where it does not apply.

## Koinon's images and chart

Each release tag publishes the images and the chart to `ghcr.io/stateracloud/koinon`
(`api`, `reconciler`, `agentd`, `flavors/opencode`, and the chart at
`oci://ghcr.io/stateracloud/koinon/charts/koinon`). The packages are private while the repository is
private, so log in to `ghcr.io` with a token that can read packages before you pull them. The
[quickstart](/docs/start/quickstart/#get-koinon) shows how to install from a release, and how to build the images
yourself instead.
