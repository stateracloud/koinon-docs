title: Export and verify the audit log
description: The JSON lines export format of the audit chains, the hash encoding, and how to check a copy off the cluster.
---

The install log and each org's audit log are hash chains (see [the audit log](/docs/operate/audit/)). You can
export a chain as JSON lines and check the copy anywhere, with no database: with `koinon-api audit verify
--file`, or with any tool that implements the hash described below. Nothing is deleted by an export.

## Export

```sh
# from the cluster
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api audit export --scope install > install.jsonl
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api audit export --scope org --org <org-id> > org.jsonl
# only the events from chain_seq 120 on
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api audit export --scope install --from-seq 120 > install-120.jsonl

# or over the admin API, streamed
curl -f -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://koinon.example.com/admin/v1/audit/export" > org.jsonl
curl -f -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://koinon.example.com/admin/v1/audit/export?scope=install" > install.jsonl
```

The admin API follows the rules of the read. `scope=org` (the default) exports the token's own org;
naming another org with `org=` is 403. `scope=install` needs a token whose root user is a platform
admin, checked on every request. The export reads the chain page by page and writes each line as it
goes, so a long chain is not held in memory.

A failure before the first line (a `fromSeq` beyond the chain, say) is an ordinary error response. A failure
after it cannot change the status any more, so the server cuts the connection: the client sees a broken
transfer (curl exits non-zero), never a body that ends cleanly. `koinon-api audit export --out <file>`
creates a new file and removes it again when the export fails, so a partial file is never left behind.

## Format `koinon.audit.export.v2`

The first line is the header, then one line per event in `chain_seq` order. Every line is one JSON object.
An install `audit.anchor` event is followed by an `anchor_heads` stream line with that anchor's org
heads (see [Anchors](#anchors)); the header never lists them.

```json
{"format":"koinon.audit.export.v2","chain":"install","install_id":"0192...","from_seq":1,"head":{"chain_seq":2,"hash":"9f2c...64 hex digits"}}
{"chain_seq":1,"id":"0192...","actor_kind":"system","actor_id":"koinon-api:bootstrap","action":"platform_admin.bootstrap","target_kind":"user","target_id":"0192...","summary_text":"{\"after\": {}}","summary":{"after":{}},"request_id":"","created_at_micros":1788000000000000,"prev_hash":"0000...","hash":"ab12..."}
```

| Header field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `format` | Always `koinon.audit.export.v2`. |
| `chain` | `install` or `org`. |
| `install_id` | The install's ID (lower-case UUID text). |
| `org_id` | The org's ID, for `chain: org` only. |
| `from_seq` | `chain_seq` of the first event line: 1 for the whole chain. |
| `head` | `chain_seq` and `hash` of the chain's last event when the export started. Events appended later are not in the file. |

An event line has `chain_seq`, `id`, `actor_kind`, `actor_id`, `action`, `target_kind`, `target_id`,
`request_id`, `created_at_micros` (microseconds since the Unix epoch), `prev_hash` and `hash` (64
lower-case hex digits), and the summary twice: `summary_text` is the text Postgres prints for the `jsonb`
value, which is what the hash covers, and `summary` is the same value as a JSON object for readers. A
verifier must hash `summary_text` and refuse a line where `summary` is another value, or where the line
or its `summary` holds a key twice at any depth (readers disagree on which of the two values counts). The summaries are
the scrubbed audit data; an export holds no key material and no secret values.

## The hash

`hash = sha256(canonical_row || prev_hash)`. `canonical_row` is a list of fields, each written as its UTF-8
byte length as an 8-byte big-endian integer followed by its bytes. `prev_hash` follows as its 32 raw bytes
(32 zero bytes for `chain_seq` 1). The fields, in order:

1. the tag: `koinon.install_audit.v1` for the install chain, `koinon.audit.v1` for an org chain;
2. the scope ID: the header's `install_id` (install chain) or `org_id` (org chain), as lower-case UUID text;
3. `id`;
4. `chain_seq` in decimal;
5. `actor_kind`, `actor_id`, `action`, `target_kind`, `target_id`;
6. `summary_text`;
7. `request_id`;
8. `created_at_micros` in decimal.

In Python:

```python
import hashlib, struct

def field(s): b = s.encode(); return struct.pack(">Q", len(b)) + b

def event_hash(tag, scope, e):
    row = b"".join(field(x) for x in [tag, scope, e["id"], str(e["chain_seq"]), e["actor_kind"], e["actor_id"],
        e["action"], e["target_kind"], e["target_id"], e["summary_text"], e["request_id"], str(e["created_at_micros"])])
    return hashlib.sha256(row + bytes.fromhex(e["prev_hash"])).hexdigest()
```

A chain holds when, for every line: `chain_seq` is one more than the line before (the first is `from_seq`),
`prev_hash` is the hash of the line before (zeros for `chain_seq` 1), `hash` is the recomputed hash, and the
last line's `chain_seq` and `hash` are the header's `head`. A line removed from the end shows against the head.

## Verify off the cluster

```sh
koinon-api audit verify --file install.jsonl
```

The binary runs anywhere and needs no database. It prints `ok` or `BROKEN` with the first `chain_seq` that
does not fit, and exits non-zero when the file does not hold. A changed field, a removed or swapped line and
a truncated tail each fail with that `chain_seq`. The file is read one line at a time.

A partial export (`--from-seq`) has no line to take its first `prev_hash` from. Check it against an earlier
export that ends at the line before:

```sh
koinon-api audit verify --file install-120.jsonl --after install.jsonl
```

`--after` verifies the earlier file too, then requires its last `hash` to be the partial file's first
`prev_hash`. Without `--after` the partial file's own links are checked and the report says the first
`prev_hash` was not.

**A file verified alone proves internal consistency only, not authenticity; use `--after`, or `--anchors`
with an install export (later checkpoints), to pin it.** `verify --file` prints this as a `note` line
whenever neither is given. The hashes show that the file is a consistent chain with the head it names, not
that the head is the chain's real head: someone who rewrites a whole copy from the start, header included,
gets a file that verifies. Compare the head with one you kept earlier (an earlier export given to
`--after`), or an org export with an install export you kept (`--anchors`). Signed checkpoints that pin
the head outside the database are planned (ADR 0100); `verify --file` will check them when they exist.

## Anchors

Every hour (`--audit-anchor-interval` on koinon-api, at least 5 minutes, because every anchor stores one row per org) and on demand with
`koinon-api audit anchor`, koinon-api writes an `audit.anchor` event to the install chain. It commits to the
head (`chain_seq` and `hash`) of every org chain at that moment: the event's summary holds `org_count` and
`heads_root`, and the heads themselves are in an append-only table. Only one replica anchors per interval.

`heads_root` is sha256 over fields written as in [The hash](#the-hash): the tag
`koinon.install_audit.anchor.v1`, the install ID, the number of heads in decimal, then for each head in
`org_id` order the `org_id` (lower-case UUID text), the `chain_seq` in decimal and the `hash` in lower-case hex.

`koinon-api audit verify` on the database recomputes every root and checks that each org chain still has the
anchored hash at the anchored `chain_seq`. A chain rewritten or removed behind an anchor fails and names the
org and the anchor. An org created after the last anchor has nothing to check yet and passes.

An install export writes each anchor's org heads as an `anchor_heads` stream line right after the
`audit.anchor` event:

```json
{"line":"anchor_heads","chain_seq":5,"event_id":"0192...","org_count":2,"heads_root":"9f2c...","heads":[{"org_id":"0192...","chain_seq":3,"hash":"ab12..."},{"org_id":"0192...","chain_seq":7,"hash":"cd34..."}]}
```

`verify --file` checks each stream line against its event as it reads, with no database, so memory does
not grow with the number of anchors. Keep an install export, then check an org export against it:

```sh
koinon-api audit verify --file org-0192.jsonl --anchors install.jsonl
```

The install file is verified first. Every anchor that names the org must find its anchored hash in the org
file at the anchored `chain_seq`, and a break names the lowest such `chain_seq` and the anchor. This pins the
org file to what the install chain said about it when the anchors were written, so a rewrite of the org chain
after your copy of the install export was made cannot pass. A file that ends before an anchored `chain_seq`
fails with a message naming both causes: rows were removed behind the anchor, or the file is older than the
anchor (export the org after the install export). It does not stop someone who can rewrite the install chain
too (a database superuser); signed checkpoints, exported off the cluster, are for that. Watch the gauge
`koinon_audit_anchor_age_seconds` (no labels): it grows while anchoring is stuck. It keeps its last value
when the database cannot be read, so alert on the database being down as well. Alert on any increase of
`koinon_audit_anchor_inconsistent_total`: an org chain no longer matched the previous anchor when the next
one was written.

Ship the `anchored the org audit chains` log lines (they carry `heads_root` and `install_head`) off the
cluster to get a witness the database can't rewrite.

The header size does not grow with the anchor count: heads ride in the stream, not in the header.
