title: Back up and restore
description: Back up the database and the encryption keys by hand, restore them into a stopped install, and check the result.
---

A Koinon install has four parts that must agree after a restore:

| Part | Where it lives | What loses it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The database | Postgres: runs, tasks, the ledger, the `dbos` schema (pending workflows and schedules), and every stored credential as ciphertext | A lost volume, a bad upgrade, a dropped table |
| The encryption keys | The Secret `koinon-kek` (or `secrets.kek.existingSecret`), or your KMS | A deleted namespace, a new cluster |
| The install mark | The Secret `koinon-install-mark` (key `token`), made once by the chart's hook Job: it marks the OpenShell objects this install made, so another install on the same gateway leaves them alone | A deleted namespace |
| The checkpoint bucket | Your S3 bucket: the agents' homes | Nothing in this procedure touches it |

The database alone is not a backup. Provider keys, connection secrets, MCP credentials, trace
credentials and every agent's home-repository password are stored sealed under the keys, so a dump
restored without them opens nothing. Losing the keys loses every home checkpoint as well. Take both
backups together and keep them apart from each other's storage.

This page is the manual procedure for the `cnpg` and `external` database modes. It uses exactly the
commands an automated backup job would run (`pg_dump --format=custom` and `keys export`), and
Koinon's nightly end-to-end test on kind runs these blocks as written, so they are known to work. The
examples use the release name `koinon` and the namespace `koinon`; replace them with yours.

A restore into the same install is below. For a different cluster, install the same chart version
first (see [Restore into a new install](#restore-into-a-new-install)).

## Back up

### 1. The encryption keys

Export the key set from the running API. The export is a Secret manifest without a namespace:

```sh e1=backup-keys
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api keys export > koinon-kek-backup.yaml
```

Check that it holds the active key. This reads the active key's fingerprint from `keys status` and
looks for it in the export. Do it after each export, because a `keys add` and `keys activate` after
the export makes a backup that cannot open what was sealed since:

```sh e1=check-keys
fp=$(kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api keys status | awk '$2 == "active" { print $NF }')
test -n "$fp"
grep -q "fingerprint $fp" koinon-kek-backup.yaml || { echo "the backup does not hold the active key $fp" >&2; false; }
```

If you use a KMS, back up the KMS key as your KMS documents; the Secret then holds only wrapped
keys. The [key runbook](/docs/operate/secret-keys/)
covers rotation, retired keys (keep every key that a database backup still needs) and what a lost key
costs.

### 2. The database

**cnpg mode.** The rendered CloudNativePG Cluster `<release>-pg` has no backup configured. Dump the
database from its primary pod. The database is `postgres.cnpg.database` (default `koinon`); the dump
covers every schema, including `dbos`:

```sh e1=backup-db
PRIMARY=$(kubectl -n koinon get pod -l cnpg.io/cluster=koinon-pg,cnpg.io/instanceRole=primary -o name)
kubectl -n koinon exec "$PRIMARY" -c postgres -- pg_dump --format=custom --dbname=koinon > koinon.dump
```

**external mode.** Take your provider's snapshot, or run `pg_dump --format=custom` as the migration
role against the same database. Use a `pg_dump` of the same major version as the server or newer.

The dump runs while Koinon is up and is consistent as of one instant. Runs, tasks and ledger entries
written after it are not in it.

Check that the dump can be read. `pg_restore --list` reads the whole archive's table of contents and
fails on a truncated file:

```sh e1=verify-dump
PRIMARY=$(kubectl -n koinon get pod -l cnpg.io/cluster=koinon-pg,cnpg.io/instanceRole=primary -o name)
kubectl -n koinon exec -i "$PRIMARY" -c postgres -- pg_restore --list < koinon.dump > /dev/null
```

### 3. The install mark

Export the Secret without its namespace and cluster metadata, so it can be applied elsewhere. It holds
a random token that is not in the database. You need it only to restore as a replacement (see
[Restore into a new install](#restore-into-a-new-install)), but it is small and cheap to keep:

```sh
kubectl -n koinon get secret koinon-install-mark -o json \
  | jq '{apiVersion, kind, type, metadata: {name: .metadata.name}, data}' > koinon-install-mark-backup.json
```

Note the chart version (`helm -n koinon list`). Restore with that version. To restore onto a newer
chart, run `helm upgrade` after the restore so the migration Job brings the schema forward; a dump
never goes back into an older release's pods.

## Restore

Restore into a stopped install. The steps below replace the database with the dump and put the keys
back. Everything written after the backup is lost.

### 1. Stop

Scale agentd down first, so it drains, then the reconciler and the API. The database, the gateway and
OpenShell stay up. Sandboxes keep running while Koinon is stopped, but no run makes progress and no
schedule fires.

```sh e1=stop
kubectl -n koinon scale deployment/koinon-agentd --replicas=0
kubectl -n koinon wait --for=delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=koinon,app.kubernetes.io/component=agentd --timeout=10m
kubectl -n koinon scale deployment/koinon-reconciler deployment/koinon-api --replicas=0
kubectl -n koinon wait --for=delete pod -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance=koinon,app.kubernetes.io/component in (api,reconciler)' --timeout=5m
```

If `wait` prints "no matching resources found", the pods were already gone.

Now put the install in restore-hold mode, before anything starts again. A held install starts, serves
its health checks and answers reads, but acts on nothing: no schedule fires and no pending workflow
is recovered, no run is claimed and no expired run lease is taken over, no sandbox is created,
stopped or recreated, and no code-host scope or price list is fetched. The API also refuses the outward calls an
admin could start (a provider check, a connection test, an MCP server add, a trace destination
test, approving a request, Run now; denying one stays open) until you release the hold. No new work is queued
while it holds: Run now, creating a task or ticket, sending a follow-up message and sending a direct message are all refused. The declarative importer
skips an `mcp-server` Secret that would dial out (a new server or a changed URL) and logs
`held: MCP server <name> not applied until release`; it applies the rest of the Secrets and imports the skipped
one after the release. The hold does not stop sandboxes that are already running: if you restore in place while
sandboxes are live, stop them first (their model calls go through agentgateway, not through Koinon). Without the hold, the first
start would run every due schedule once, let agentd take over every run whose lease ran out while the
install was down, and let the reconciler converge sandboxes against the restored state, all before
you have looked at it. The hold is one environment variable on the three Deployments (they are
scaled to 0, so nothing restarts):

```sh e1=hold
kubectl -n koinon set env deployment/koinon-api deployment/koinon-reconciler deployment/koinon-agentd KOINON_RESTORE_HOLD=true
```

With Helm or GitOps, skip this command: the hold goes in with the chart value in step 4, after the
database and the keys are back.

### 2. Restore the database

Drop the schemas the dump will bring back, then load it. `--exit-on-error` stops at the first
problem instead of leaving a half-restored database.

**cnpg mode:**

```sh e1=restore-db
PRIMARY=$(kubectl -n koinon get pod -l cnpg.io/cluster=koinon-pg,cnpg.io/instanceRole=primary -o name)
kubectl -n koinon exec "$PRIMARY" -c postgres -- psql --dbname=koinon -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  -c 'DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS dbos CASCADE' -c 'DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE' -c 'CREATE SCHEMA public AUTHORIZATION pg_database_owner' -c 'GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO PUBLIC'
kubectl -n koinon exec -i "$PRIMARY" -c postgres -- pg_restore --dbname=koinon --exit-on-error < koinon.dump
```

**external mode:** restore your provider's snapshot, or run the same two steps with `psql` and
`pg_restore` against your database as a role that owns the schemas.

Restore schema and data together into an empty schema, as above. A data-only restore onto a migrated
database stops on the install ID (see the runbook's "The install binding"). The install ID travels
with the dump, so a restored database and a restored key Secret match in either order.

### 3. Restore the keys

If the Secret is still there and is the one from the backup, there is nothing to do. If it is gone
or newer than the backup, restore the backup:

```sh e1=restore-keys
kubectl -n koinon apply -f koinon-kek-backup.yaml
```

koinon-api refuses to start without the Secret and never makes a new key when the database already
holds sealed values (it says "KEK Secret missing; restore it from your backup"). A Secret with the
wrong keys shows in the start-up log and in `keys status`.

### 4. Start, held

Scale the components back to the replica counts in your values (`helm -n koinon get values koinon`).
The default is one each. Start the API and reconciler first, then agentd. All three log
"restore-hold" and report `koinon_restore_hold 1` on `/metrics`:

```sh e1=start
kubectl -n koinon scale deployment/koinon-api deployment/koinon-reconciler --replicas=1
kubectl -n koinon rollout status deployment/koinon-api deployment/koinon-reconciler --timeout=5m
kubectl -n koinon scale deployment/koinon-agentd --replicas=1
kubectl -n koinon rollout status deployment/koinon-agentd --timeout=5m
```

With Helm or GitOps, do not run `kubectl scale` or the `set env` command from step 1. Set the chart
value `restoreHold: true` and upgrade. That starts the three Deployments held, after the database and
the keys are back (an upgrade earlier would start them against a database that step 2 replaces), and
a GitOps controller with self-heal would undo a `kubectl scale`. Set it back to `false` to release. Do
not mix the two ways: a variable set with `kubectl set env` is not in the chart, so a Helm upgrade
neither adds nor removes it.

Starting the API again is also what makes it read the restored install ID. Ready means the process
is up and its schema is supported; a held install is Ready and does nothing.

### 5. Rebuild the checkpoint list

The bucket was not restored with the database, so the restored list of home checkpoints is older than
the bucket: it lacks snapshots written since the dump, and it can name snapshots that retention has
since deleted. Rebuild it from the bucket once agentd is up (it is a no-op for an install without
checkpoints):

```sh e1=resync
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api checkpoints resync --all
```

[After a database restore](/docs/use/home-checkpoints/#after-a-database-restore) says what it changes.
Run it before `keys forget` or any key compromise procedure. This is the one job agentd does while
held: it reads the bucket and writes the checkpoint list, and touches no sandbox.

## Check the result, held

The install is held, so you can look at it before it acts.

1. `kubectl -n koinon get pods`: the three Deployments and the gateway are Ready.
2. `kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api keys status` lists the keys, marks the
   active one and prints no warning about a missing key or a fingerprint that differs.

Open every stored credential with the restored keys. `keys verify` reads each sealed value (provider
and cost keys, connection secrets, MCP and trace credentials, home-repository passwords), opens it
and prints one line for each that does not. It changes nothing and writes no audit event, and it
does not print a value:

```sh e1=verify-keys
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api keys verify
```

It exits 1 when a value does not open. `unknown_kek` means the key backup lacks the key that sealed
the value: apply the backup that holds it (step 3) and run it again. `open` means the key is there
but the value does not open, so the database and the keys come from different installs.

Then look at the backlog: sign in and see the queued and running runs, and the schedule triggers with
their next due times. Runs that were running when the backup was taken are `running` with an expired
lease; they wait for the release.

Tighten what the backlog may do on release. An org's cap on runs that start or run at once is read
at every claim, so a lower cap also holds back the runs that are already queued. Show an org's
limits and set a lower cap (`--org` takes the slug or the ID; `0` returns a limit to the default):

```sh
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api org-limits show --org acme
kubectl -n koinon exec deploy/koinon-api -- koinon-api org-limits set --org acme --max-concurrent-runs 2
```

`--trigger-concurrency` and `--trigger-rate-per-minute` bound the org's share of the trigger queue
the same way. Every change is audited as `org.run_limits.set` (actor `cli`). Raise the cap again
when the backlog has drained.

## Release

When the checks pass, release the hold. Each Deployment restarts without the variable and starts to
act: the DBOS runtime starts and recovers the workflows that were pending in the dump, schedules fire
again on their next due time (a schedule that came due while the install was down fires once), agentd
claims runs and takes over the expired leases, and the reconciler converges the sandboxes.

```sh e1=release
kubectl -n koinon set env deployment/koinon-api deployment/koinon-reconciler deployment/koinon-agentd KOINON_RESTORE_HOLD-
kubectl -n koinon rollout status deployment/koinon-api deployment/koinon-reconciler deployment/koinon-agentd --timeout=5m
```

Start a run to prove that a stored provider key is decrypted. If you held the install with the chart
value, set `restoreHold: false` and upgrade instead.

## Restore into a new install

To restore into another cluster or namespace, create the namespace and the OpenShell client
certificate and install the same chart version with your values, as in the
[Quickstart](/docs/start/quickstart/#2-install). Then follow the Restore steps above from step 1. Apply the key
backup before the first start, if you can: a new install makes its own key Secret on first start,
and step 3 replaces it with yours.

Then decide about the install mark. If the new install **replaces** the old one on the same OpenShell
gateway, stop the old install first (scale its Deployments to zero or uninstall it). Two running
installs with the same mark both own the objects, which is the clash this mark prevents. Then
apply the mark backup before step 4 (Start), so the new install owns the sandboxes, providers and
workspaces the old one made. The pods read the mark from the Secret only when they start; a pod that is
already running keeps the mark it had until you restart it.

```sh
kubectl -n koinon apply -f koinon-install-mark-backup.json
```

If you restore a **copy next to the live install** (a drill), do not apply it. The copy keeps the
mark its own chart install made, and then it cannot touch the live install's objects. With the live
mark, the copy would own them and could stop and delete them.

Use the same `postgres.mode` as the install the dump came from; a `cnpg` install cannot be pointed at
a database restored somewhere else.

### Two installs on one OpenShell gateway

A restored copy that runs next to the live install on the same gateway computes the same sandbox,
provider and workspace names, because the org and agent IDs are the same. Every OpenShell object Koinon
makes carries an install mark: a hash of a random token in the Secret `koinon-install-mark`, which the
chart's hook Job creates once. The token is not in Postgres, so a restored database does not bring it:
the copy gets its own, whatever its namespace is called and on whatever cluster it runs. A Koinon
install does not adopt, stop, change, exec in or delete an object that has another install's mark. The
reconcile of that agent fails with "owned by another install", the agent's row goes to `error` (so
`koinon-agentd` fails its runs and does not run them in the other install's sandbox), and the live
install is not touched. The copy cannot run those agents on that gateway: give it its own gateway for a
drill that needs running sandboxes.

The Secret outlives `helm uninstall` and upgrades. If it is lost (the namespace is deleted), the install
no longer owns its objects. To take them back, apply the mark you backed up (step 3 of Back up), or
create `koinon-install-mark` again with the old `token`
(`installMark.existingSecret` names a Secret you manage), or delete the install's sandboxes, providers
and workspaces on the gateway so that the reconciler makes them again with the new mark.

Objects made before this mark existed have none, and an unmarked object is open to a second install:
the copy cannot tell it from its own, and can claim, stop or delete it. The live install marks them
over several passes after the upgrade (see [Upgrading](/docs/operate/upgrading/#upgrading-to-install-marked-openshell-objects)):
a sandbox is recreated with the mark only when no run holds the agent and within the per-pass recreate
cap, and a provider that a sandbox still attaches is remade only on the pass after that sandbox is gone.
One pass is therefore not enough.

Run a copy on the same gateway only when **every sandbox, provider and provider profile of the live
install carries the mark**. Check it on the live install's reconciler metrics
([Metrics](/docs/operate/metrics/)):

```promql
koinon_openshell_unmarked_objects
koinon_openshell_unmarked_objects_stale
```

The condition is that the first gauge is 0 for each of `kind="sandbox"`, `"provider"` and `"profile"` **and**
the second is 0. A stale value of 1 means the last count of the gateway failed (or none has run yet), so the
zeros may be old. The count runs at most once per resync interval, so after a change wait for one interval before you read it. The count lists the gateway, so it also covers agents that a pass held back or failed
on, and archived (`retained`) sandboxes. The reconciler claims a retained sandbox only when it recreates it,
and an archived agent is not reconciled. Unarchive such an agent on the live install first and wait until it
is recreated with the mark (you can archive it again after that). Delete its sandbox on the gateway only when
you do not need its home volume: that data is gone. If the gauge is not 0, wait: runs that hold an agent finish, and the next passes recreate those sandboxes. To go faster,
raise `reconciler.maxRecreatesPerPass` (default 4) with a `helm upgrade`, or end the runs that hold
the agents. Do not delete the sandboxes on the gateway by hand to speed it up: the reconciler recreates
them, but only on a pass when no run holds the agent, and the home volume is replaced.

### Find the unmarked objects

List the OpenShell objects this install does not own yet, and why. From the reconciler pod:

```bash
kubectl --context <ctx> -n <ns> exec deploy/<release>-reconciler -- koinon-reconciler unmarked list
```

Add `--json` for scripts. Each line is workspace, kind, name and reason. The command only reads, and it
never lists an object that carries another install's mark.

| Reason | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `pending-claim` | An active agent's object, or the profile of a configured flavor. The next reconcile claims it. | Nothing; wait for the reconcile. |
| `draft-agent` | A draft agent's object, or a flavor profile only draft and archived agents use, that the reconciler claims on its next pass. | Nothing, unless it is still listed after a pass. Then one of these holds: the agent's key Secret no longer matches its recorded key, or the agent has no key; the flavor is not rendered by this install; or ownership is off (no install mark, so `koinon_openshell_unmarked_objects_stale` reads 1). Fix that cause, or activate or archive the agent. |
| `archived-agent` | A flavor profile only archived agents use (the org pass marks it), or an archived agent's object that its cleanup removes. | Nothing; archiving keeps the org's data. |
| `waits-for-agent` | The reconciler cannot claim it while the agent keeps its status: a draft agent's sandbox in any state other than pending or deleted, with the providers and the GitHub profile it attaches (claimed when the agent is activated; when it is archived, the sandbox is removed, or kept as a retained sandbox under the `retain` home policy), and an archived agent's retained sandbox (claimed when the agent is unarchived). | Activate or archive the draft agent. Unarchive the archived agent, or delete its retained sandbox by hand once its home is no longer wanted. |
| `org-not-in-db` | In a workspace that no org of this database owns (a deleted org counts). Nothing of this install claims it. On a gateway shared with another install, the line can belong to that install, which has not claimed its objects yet (its workspace carries no mark yet). | Delete it by hand (below), but not on a shared gateway before you check with the other install; it lists the object under one of its own reasons. |
| `not-reconciler-made` | Not made by the reconciler, or this database has no record of it. Nothing claims it. | Check who made it; delete it only if you are sure it is yours. |

The `pending-claim`, `draft-agent` and `archived-agent` lines clear within a few passes. The
`org-not-in-db` and `not-reconciler-made` lines do not clear by themselves, so they keep
`koinon_openshell_unmarked_objects` above 0. The `waits-for-agent` lines are counted apart, in
`koinon_openshell_unmarked_objects_waiting_for_agent{kind}`, and do not block: 0 in the first gauge means
no object without a known owner is left.

A restored copy of the same database sees those agents in the same status and does not claim their
objects either. Do not activate or unarchive agents on the copy. Take the drill's backup only after
`koinon_openshell_unmarked_objects` reads 0 for every kind and `koinon_openshell_unmarked_objects_stale`
reads 0. Do not return an agent to draft or archive it on the live install until the drill is over. An
agent that was active in the backup and is draft or archived on the live install is hidden as
`waits-for-agent` here, but the copy sees it active and recreates its sandbox, which deletes the live
home volume. If that happens, keep the copy held (a held reconciler converges no sandbox) and take the
backup again once the gauges read 0.

To delete an `org-not-in-db` object on the gateway, go in this order: sandbox, providers, profiles, then
the workspace. OpenShell refuses to delete a profile that a provider still uses, or a workspace that
still holds objects. There is no `--delete-orphans` yet.

## What to automate, and what is not covered

An automated job runs the same commands on a schedule: a `pg_dump --format=custom` and a `keys export`
taken together, stored away from the cluster, with the fingerprint check after each. A CNPG
`ScheduledBackup` or your provider's snapshots are the equivalent for the database alone; they still
need the key backup beside them.

Not covered here: the checkpoint bucket's own durability (use your storage provider's versioning or
replication), and a standalone database mode, which has its own backup set
([ADR 0076](https://github.com/stateracloud/koinon/blob/main/docs/adr/0076-database-modes.md)).
Koinon records the time a restore took and the data it lost in the full restore drill it runs before
each release
([ADR 0085](https://github.com/stateracloud/koinon/blob/main/docs/adr/0085-upgrade-compatibility-and-recovery-policy.md));
there are no targets yet.
